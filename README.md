# Dolphin: The Ultimate Jumper

A lightweight, browser-based endless runner game where a dolphin leaps over icy obstacles, surfs the waves, and survives as long as possible. Inspired by simple runner mechanics, this project focuses on smooth animation, responsive controls, and clean game logic using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
